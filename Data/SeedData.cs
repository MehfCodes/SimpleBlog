After moving from Los Angeles to New York City in 1991, Buckley amassed a following through his performances at Sin-&eacute;, a cafe in the East Village, and signed to Columbia in 1993. He recorded Grace in Bearsville Studios in Woodstock, New York, with musicians including Gary Lucas, Mick Grondahl, Michael Tighe and Matt Johnson. It includes versions of the jazz standard &quot;Lilac Wine&quot;, the hymn &quot;Corpus Christi Carol&quot; and the 1984 Leonard Cohen song &quot;Hallelujah&quot;. Grace reached number 149 on the US Billboard 200, below Columbia&#39;s expectations, and initially received mixed reviews. After Buckley&#39;s death in 1997, its critical standing grew and it was praised by musicians including Jimmy Page, Robert Plant, Bob Dylan and David Bowie. By 2011, it had achieved sales of two million, and in 2016 it was certified platinum in the US. Rolling Stone included Grace in three of its lists of the 500 greatest albums and named Buckley&#39;s version of &quot;Hallelujah&quot; one of the 500 greatest songs. In 2008, &quot;Hallelujah&quot; became Buckley&#39;s first number one on Billboard&#39;s Hot Digital Songs and reached number two in the UK singles chart. In 2014, &quot;Hallelujah&quot; was inducted into the American Library of Congress&#39; National Recording Registry.</p><p><br></p>",

                            Content = @"Nirvana was an American rock band formed in Aberdeen, Washington, in 1987. Founded by lead singer and guitarist Kurt Cobain and bassist Krist Novoselic, the band went through a succession of drummers, most notably Chad Channing, before recruiting Dave Grohl in 1990. Nirvana's success popularized alternative rock, and they were often referenced as the figurehead band of Generation X. Their music maintains a popular following and continues to influence rock culture.

                                In the late 1980s, Nirvana established itself as part of the Seattle grunge scene. They released their first album, Bleach, for the independent record label Sub Pop in 1989. Their sound relied on dynamic contrasts, often between quiet verses and loud, heavy choruses. After signing to the major label DGC Records in 1990, Nirvana found unexpected mainstream success with ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"", the first single from its landmark second album, Nevermind (1991). A cultural phenomenon of the 1990s, Nevermind was certified 13× Platinum in the US and is credited for ending the popularity of hair metal.

                                Characterized by a punk aesthetic, Nirvana's fusion of pop melodies with noise, combined with its themes of abjection and social alienation, brought them global popularity. Following extensive touring and the 1992 compilation album Incesticide and EP Hormoaning, the band released its highly anticipated third studio album, In Utero (1993). The album topped both the US and UK album charts, and was acclaimed by critics. Nirvana disbanded following Cobain's suicide in April 1994. Further releases have been overseen by Novoselic, Grohl, and Cobain's widow, Courtney Love. The live album MTV Unplugged in New York (1994) won Best Alternative Music Performance at the 1996 Grammy Awards.

                                Nirvana is one of the best-selling bands of all time, having sold more than 75 million records worldwide, including certified sales of 60 million in the US.During its three years as a mainstream act, Nirvana received an American Music Award, Brit Award, and Grammy Award, as well as seven MTV Video Music Awards and two NME Awards. The band achieved five number-one hits on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart and four number-one albums on the Billboard 200. In 2010, Rolling Stone ranked Nirvana No. 30 in its list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2014, their first year of eligibility. In 2023, they received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.",

Even with a hint of grunge in the guitars, &ldquo;Lover&rdquo; is essentially a soul ballad, its intensity mounting from a low boil early to emotive eruptions at the end. Buckley the singer knocks it out of the park, but Buckley the songwriter provided some juicy raw material.</p><p style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin-block: 24px 0px; max-width: 1248px; margin-left: auto !important; margin-right: auto !important; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.56; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 24px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;"" data-pasted=""true"">The song could have been just your typical lament from a lonely lover, but Buckley deepens the material by providing insight into the narrator&rsquo;s psyche and how it prevents him from the blissful reunion he seeks. &ldquo;Too young to hold on,&rdquo; he sings. &ldquo;And too old to just break free and run.&rdquo; That earthly purgatory between the two extremes is a place of endless torment, but it&rsquo;s presented here as a kind of rite of passage: &ldquo;Sometimes a man must awake to find, really/ He has no one.&rdquo;</p><p style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin-block: 24px 0px; max-width: 1248px; margin-left: auto !important; margin-right: auto !important; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.56; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 24px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;"">Once the narrator has established how he is complicit in his own agony, he can reveal just how deep it goes. Toward the end of the song, Buckley starts a series of lines with the phrase &ldquo;It&rsquo;s never over,&rdquo; with each successive line revealing just how bad he&rsquo;s got it. &ldquo;My kingdom for a kiss upon your shoulder,&rdquo; he sings, a twist on Richard III&rsquo;s request for a horse. Indeed he would give it all, his kingdom, his riches, even his blood, but he knows it won&rsquo;t be near enough: &ldquo;She is the tear that hangs within my soul forever.&rdquo;</p><p style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin-block: 24px 0px; max-width: 1248px; margin-left: auto !important; margin-right: auto !important; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.56; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 24px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;"">In the closing moments, Buckley pretty much leaves words behind, relying on a series of guttural moans and pain-wracked yelps to convey his feelings. Finally he leaves us with a sliver of hope for this fractured couple: &ldquo;Lover, you should&rsquo;ve come over/ &lsquo;Cause it&rsquo;s not too late.&rdquo; Jeff Buckley&rsquo;s haunting singing voice will never be forgotten, even considering the very short time it graced the world&rsquo;s stage. &ldquo;Lover, You Should&rsquo;ve Come Over&rdquo; proves how badly his songwriting is missed as well.</p>

The 16-hour marathon would feature titans from Bob Dylan and Led Zeppelin to Paul McCartney and Madonna taking the stage at both London&rsquo;s Wembley Stadium and Philadelphia&rsquo;s John F. Kennedy Stadium for what was being billed as a &ldquo;global jukebox.&rdquo; Each performer or group was allotted just around 20 minutes.</p><p style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin-block: 0px; overflow-wrap: break-word;""><br></p><div data-sentry-element=""Component"" data-sentry-source-file=""box.tsx"" data-sentry-component=""Box"" style='box-sizing: border-box; white-space: pre-line; color: rgb(60, 60, 60); --_42elsx0: 22; font-size: 22px; line-height: 28.6px; letter-spacing: -0.44px; font-family: ""Crimson Text""; --o2jrjz2: 64px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;' data-pasted=""true""><p style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin-block: 0px; overflow-wrap: break-word;"">Queen almost didn&#39;t accept Geldof&rsquo;s invitation. For one thing, they were worn out from touring all spring. When Geldof and Ure left Queen off an earlier fundraiser, the Band Aid single &ldquo;Do They Know It&rsquo;s Christmas?,&rdquo; Mercury remarked to his bandmates, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a bit old,&rdquo; according to Blake&rsquo;s book. May recalled to Blake, &ldquo;We definitely hesitated about doing Live Aid. Not just Freddie. We had to consider whether we were in good enough shape to do it. It would have been easier not to do it as the chances of making fools of ourselves were so big.&rdquo;</p></div><div data-sentry-element=""Component"" data-sentry-source-file=""box.tsx"" data-sentry-component=""Box"" style='box-sizing: border-box; white-space: pre-line; color: rgb(60, 60, 60); --_42elsx0: 22; font-size: 22px; line-height: 28.6px; letter-spacing: -0.44px; font-family: ""Crimson Text""; --o2jrjz2: 64px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;'><p style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin-block: 0px; overflow-wrap: break-word;"">Against that backdrop, their motivations appear not to have been purely philanthropic. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think they were there purely for charity reasons,&rdquo; says Blake, quickly adding, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t think other bands were either. If you had a good Live Aid, that did wonders for your career.&rdquo; In fact, when a BBC interviewer asked Queen later if they were playing to support the cause or because they didn&rsquo;t want to miss out, Mercury replied candidly, &ldquo;A bit of both.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p></div><div data-sentry-element=""Component"" data-sentry-source-file=""box.tsx"" data-sentry-component=""Box"" style='box-sizing: border-box; white-space: pre-line; color: rgb(60, 60, 60); --_42elsx0: 22; font-size: 22px; line-height: 28.6px; letter-spacing: -0.44px; font-family: ""Crimson Text""; --o2jrjz2: 64px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;'><p style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin-block: 0px; overflow-wrap: break-word;"">Meanwhile, Mercury had bigger concerns: Though he wouldn&rsquo;t be diagnosed until 1987, the singer had in 1982 sought medical treatment after he began showing symptoms of HIV.

At the time, the disease was still a death sentence, so Mercury would have known that his days&mdash;and performances&mdash;were numbered.

Over three full days at London&rsquo;s Shaw Theatre, they painstakingly rehearsed their set, opting for a medley that would deliver maximum crowd satisfaction&mdash;namely, the high moments of six of the band&rsquo;s hits: &ldquo;Bohemian Rhapsody,&rdquo; &ldquo;Radio Ga Ga,&rdquo; &ldquo;Hammer To Fall,&rdquo; &ldquo;Crazy Little Thing Called Love,&rdquo; &ldquo;We Will Rock You&rdquo; and, the grand finale, the &uuml;ber-anthemic &ldquo;We Are the Champions.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin-block: 0px; overflow-wrap: break-word;""><br></p><div data-sentry-element=""Component"" data-sentry-source-file=""box.tsx"" data-sentry-component=""Box"" style='box-sizing: border-box; white-space: pre-line; color: rgb(60, 60, 60); --_42elsx0: 22; font-size: 22px; line-height: 28.6px; letter-spacing: -0.44px; font-family: ""Crimson Text""; --o2jrjz2: 64px; margin-top: 64px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;' data-pasted=""true""><p style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin-block: 0px; overflow-wrap: break-word;"">When the day came, some 70,000 fans (including Prince Charles and Princess Diana) packed into Wembley, while an estimated <a target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" data-sentry-element=""NextLink"" data-sentry-component=""Link"" data-sentry-source-file=""link.tsx"" href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/09/arts/music/bohemian-rhapsody-queen-live-aid.html"" style=""box-sizing: border-box; display: inline; color: inherit; cursor: pointer; text-decoration: underline from-font; text-underline-offset: 2px;""><u style=""box-sizing: border-box;"">1.5 billion</u></a> watched the television broadcast&mdash;on the BBC in the UK, on ABC in the U.S., and on upstart network MTV. If their spring tour had left Queen depleted, it didn&rsquo;t show. Mercury took charge from the start, bounding joyfully onto the stage and commanding the audience from the opening grand-piano strains of &ldquo;Bohemian Rhapsody.&rdquo; From there out, they executed the medley flawlessly, with a sneaky boost from their sound engineer, Trip Khalaf. In a 1999 interview, drummer Taylor revealed that Khalaf had tweaked the sound system so that &ldquo;we were louder than anyone else.&rdquo;</p></div><div data-sentry-element=""Component"" data-sentry-source-file=""box.tsx"" data-sentry-component=""Box"" style='box-sizing: border-box; white-space: pre-line; color: rgb(60, 60, 60); --_42elsx0: 22; font-size: 22px; line-height: 28.6px; letter-spacing: -0.44px; font-family: ""Crimson Text""; --o2jrjz2: 64px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;'><p style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin-block: 0px; overflow-wrap: break-word;"">And Mercury was not only loud, but proud. Sporting tight, high-waisted jeans and a white tank top, accessorized with matching studded black leather belt and armband, he strutted, preened and fist-pumped, owning the stage with a high-octane, camp energy. He wielded a cut-off microphone stand as an air guitar, as a baton and occasionally, in much more suggestive ways. At one point, he led the crowd in a rousing 30-second a cappella call-and-response sequence, starting &ldquo;aaay-o,&rdquo; that dramatically showcased his four-octave range.
